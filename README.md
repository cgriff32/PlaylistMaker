Make top 10 playlist from list of artists


Uses the Spotify API to create a playlist of Top 10 tracks bsed on a playlist of Artists.

To use:

1. Add credentials to the code following these instructions (https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#authorization-code-flow)
The easiest way to do this is to just add the util.prompt_for_user_token function to your code. you'll need to register for a developer token to use this.

2. Make a Public playlist named Artists 

3. Add one track from each artist you want to the playlist

4. Run the program. The program requires your spotify user id as an argument. (https://open.spotify.com/user/XXXXXXXXX) Use the X's.

5. Enjoy! Hopefully...
